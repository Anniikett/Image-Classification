# Image-Classification
Image Classification Using ANN


# Objective: Forest vs Building Classification Using ANN

Steps:
1. Importing (or installing) Tenosrflow, Keras and other packages on your system
2. Loading your data from disk
3. Creating your training and testing splits
4. Data Preprocessing 
5. Defining your tensorflow ANN model architecture
6. Compiling your tensorflow ANN model
7. Training your model on your training data
8. Evaluating your model on your test data
9. Generate Plots for accuracy and validation loss
10. Saving The train model
11. Making predictions using your trained tensorflow model
